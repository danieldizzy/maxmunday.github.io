		<h1>Hi, I'm Max Munday.</h1>
		<p>I am a student programmer, penetration tester, and information security obsessive. I am a Linux and sci-fi enthusiast, and an avid outdoorsman.</p> 

		<p>I am an experienced security and risk professional having planned and led combat and intelligence missions on multiple operations during a near decade with the Australian Army.</p> 

		<p>I am currently undertaking a Masters in Information Technology at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia. However, I get the most out of self-learning. I have given an outline of everything I have studied so far in <a href="/blog/2016/04/26/getting-a-start-in-information-security">this blog post.</a></p>
