I am creating my site from scratch mainly as a way of learning the basics of HTML and CSS.


The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I use Markdown to author my posts.

Some helpful tutorials were [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), [Thinkful's guide](https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/), and [this Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

The documentation for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) and [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) is also very helpful.
