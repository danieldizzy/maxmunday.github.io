I have had a lifelong interest in computers and technology. My mother has a Computer Science degree and we always had various computers around the house. I used several forms of Windows, Mac OS, and OS X over the years for gaming and tinkering. However, I never undertook any formal training in computing or computer science, and consider myself very much a beginner in the discipline. 


After deciding on a career realignment toward infosec, particularly pentesting, I recognised the need to up-skill myself significantly. I was surprised by how much information there was out there, and so much of it was free. A majority of the online community believed that you can go from beginner to employable through online resources alone. Of course many also recommended higher education and various certifications as an important element of employability. 


I will list some major resources I worked through to start me on my ongoing journey. Of course this is still a work in progress.

I installed and used [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) as learning tool after starting with [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/). I now use [Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/) as a daily driver, and have [Kali](https://www.kali.org/) in a VM for learning pentesting.

(I plan to get CCNA certified through another means.)
