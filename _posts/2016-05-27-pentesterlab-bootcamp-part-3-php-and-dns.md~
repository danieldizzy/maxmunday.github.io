\-\-[ Step 3 ]

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\-\-[ Installing PHP ]

\-\-[ DNS and WHOis ]

We are asked to find the name servers, mail servers, and the IP address of pentesterlab.com using the `dig` command line tool.

Running

~~~
$ dig pentesterlab.com ANY
~~~

gives us this information:

![](/pictures/dig.png){:height="305px" width="638px"}

The name servers are listed across from 'NS', the mail servers are listed across from 'MX', and the IP address is listed as 128.199.33.20. 

Whois.net is a domain lookup service that lists details about the owner and registrar of the domain. When querying pentesterlab.com we get the following information:

![](/pictures/whois.png){:height="441px" width="474px"}

Using the `whois` commandline tool, we get essentially the same information, with some extras tacked on at the end:

![](/pictures/whois_1.png){:height="810px" width="652px"}
